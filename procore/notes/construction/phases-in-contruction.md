# Overview of Construction Project Phases

In this course, we will be using a framework of three basic phases to discuss the stages of a construction project:

- Preconstruction
- Construction
- Post Construction

# Preconstruction

We will frame Preconstruction by breaking it down into four basic sub-phases:

- Planning & Design
- Bidding/Tendering
- Contracts
- Procurement

## Planning & Design


**1. Planning Phase Considerations :**


- Where will this be built?
Sometimes a Developer takes ownership of a site with an intent to build. Other times,
 there may only be a rough idea of where a project should be located, and site selection will be a longer process.

- Will it fit into the surrounding community?
Will this project match the form of the community around it and fit in with the surrounding built environment without impeding? This question is a major consideration in the design phase of the project and is often driven by local zoning code regulations.

- How much space is required?
Space is required for both the structure itself and in the surrounding built environment. How much is required to perform the project's function?

- What is the baseline budget?
This is typically determined by square-foot costing or the historical cost of building a similar structure or facility. 

- How soon is this structure required?
Oftentimes, for example, commercial projects are expected to be completed more quickly or with a stricter deadline. In Planning, a general start and end date is determined.

- What level of performance is required?
In the context of most projects, this can be referred to as "quality"; however, some types of projects require exact specifications without much deviation. Think of laboratories, factories, oil and gas facilities, healthcare facilities, etc. Other projects may perform with baseline features and affordable materials, like basic retail spaces, small homes, or modular school facilities.

**Project Delivery Methods:**

- Design-Build delivery method.
At this stage, the Owner may hire one Contractor to deliver both the design and construction of the project from concept to closeout. That Contractor may have Architects, Engineers, and construction teams directly on-staff, or they may hire out those parties to complete the work.
To sum it up, design-build traditionally means that there is only one contract between the Owner and the party that will deliver the project.

- The Design-Bid-Build 
In a design-bid-build format, the Owner separately contracts the Architect and Contractor. 
 The architectural design firm is hired to deliver complete design documents and then the 
 Owner will use those designs to solicit bids from General Contractors to perform the work.
 The General Contractor will then be responsible for hiring Specialty Contractors and Vendors to complete that work. 


**2. Design**

By this point, “what” is being built has been well established. Whether it is a design-build or design-bid-build project, the Design phase is what takes a project from a concept to the detailed documents, plans, and drawings that the Contractor will later follow throughout the building process. 


Typically, the architectural design process consists of these four sub-phases, and designs will advance in complexity as they near construction: 

- Conceptual Design
In the Conceptual Design phase, the Architect will take the Owner’s project proposal and continually weigh form and function. How a project needs to perform, who will be primarily using it, and where it is located will have a tremendous influence on the design of the project. All jurisdictional regulations will be measured here to ensure a project is designed to be fully compliant with the building code and zoning regulations of its location. 

- Schematic Design
Once all of the necessary information is gathered in the Conceptual Design phase, we move into schematic design(s), also called SDs. Schematic Design is when a project really begins to be visualized--those line drawings and blueprints we are so familiar with. 
Floor plans, site plans, and building elevations will be determined in this stage. Building systems like plumbing; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC); electrical; and mechanical will be placed into the designs in this phase, as well as interior and exterior finishes, based on how the project was programmed in the previous phase.

- Design Development
Design Development, or DD, is where the design begins to be refined and the Owner begins to make some final decisions about the design. The scope will narrow here as much as possible so that a final design can be reached and the Architect can begin the process of compiling the construction documents. The Architect may begin to look at materials here and make recommendations based on durability, aesthetics, and price. This can also be referred to as a value analysis or value engineering.

- Construction Documents
The Construction Documents phase, also referred to as CDs, is where every last detail and specification is added to the project drawings and plans. It becomes the job of the Design Team to produce all documentation necessary to start construction. Oftentimes, the Permit Set of Drawings is created around the same time and based off the construction drawings. They are then submitted to the city or municipality for approval. The more accurate the documentation, the more accurate your pricing and coordination will be, and that's important! This is no small amount of pages. The CD process alone for a small office building could result in nearly 500 plan sheets and several thousand pages of specifications.


**3. Permitting**
It's important to remember that some projects never make it past the Design phase, or can take years to make it into the Construction phase. Why is that? Some locations have extremely stringent zoning laws, building codes, or environmental impact guidelines--causing certain projects to be held in permitting for an extended period of time or never reach approval. 




## Bidding/Tendering

Outside of the US, bidding is referred to as tendering. When the construction documents are completed and permits are approved, a project can be opened for bidding. This is when the Owner will decide who, or which firm, is going to build the project. Remember, we are discussing this in the context of a design-bid-build project. In a design-build project, bidding would go a bit differently and would happen much earlier on in the process because the selected Contractor would have been responsible for the entire design process.

Who Bids?
In some cases, an Owner will have a relationship with or preference for several Contractors and invite a handful of them exclusively to bid the project. If a public utility or government agency is the Owner, they are required by law to open bidding to everyone, and are also usually obligated to take the lowest bid. Typically, a Private Owner will invite multiple General Contractors to bid a project in order to ensure the bids are competitive and comprehensive.

Bid Packages:
The plans and specifications produced in the Design phase are put into a bid package and sent out to General Contractors with an invitation to bid. The contents of a bid package can vary by place and project type, but a bid package will typically include these basic elements: an invitation to bid with instructions to bidders, a sample contract, and project plans and specifications.


Estimating and Collecting Bids:

Preparing and submitting bids/tenders can be a stressful and high-stakes time for General Contractors and Specialty Contractors bidding the project. There are many documents to review, calculations to be made, pricing to gather, and project conditions to be considered--such as logistics and schedule. Further, the bidding process is essentially how Contractors "get the work" they need to generate revenue for their company. The accuracy of the bidding/estimating also directly impacts how profitable/unprofitable a project will likely be in the event that the Contractor wins the bid and is awarded the contract for the project. If their bid is inaccurate, they may not have enough money allocated to cover costs; or if their estimate is too high, they may not be competitive enough to secure the project.

General Contractors largely depend on Specialty Contractors to prepare bids for their scope of work. In this way, the General Contractor's bid is only as good as their Specialty Contractors' bids. The GC will typically send invitations to bid to 3-5 Specialty Contractors per trade--for example, three Electricians, five concrete Specialty Contractors, etc. This allows for multiple estimates in each trade to be received. We sometimes refer to this as "bid coverage," which means the General Contractor has multiple options to choose from. Each bid is analyzed by the General Contractor for accuracy against the plans and specs and for competitiveness against bids in the same trade. One bid is selected per trade and is then compiled into the General Contractor's singular estimate/bid that encompasses all the scope and costs to construct the project.

General Contractors and Specialty Contractors use technology to help organize and create their bids/estimates. They may use spreadsheets with formulas, specialized estimating/bidding software, or a combination of both to prepare their bids. They may also prepare additional proposal documents, such as preliminary schedules, a list of inclusions and exclusions, and/or team resumes or completed project references. 


## Contracts

Every construction contract is unique because it reflects the specifics of each project and team members involved. There are, however, common contract types that determine how the financial aspects of a project are defined and managed. Construction doesn't happen without a contract! 

Four basic contract types:

- Lump Sum
Lump Sum contracts are for a single fixed price based upon the plans and specifications available during the bid. Should the plans and specifications change due to Owner request, unforeseen conditions, or needed clarifications, the contract cost will be increased via change order. These contracts are also sometimes referred to as "fixed price" or "stipulated sum." This is one of the most common contract types.


- Cost Plus Fee
In a Cost Plus Fee contract, the Owner agrees to reimburse the General Contractor for the cost of construction plus pays an additional fee for the Contractor's overhead and profit. In this scenario, the Contractor has little incentive to keep costs low because the more they spend, the more they make. Reimbursable costs in this scenario are typically clearly defined, but labor and material may be marked up at the convenience of the Contractor, shifting the risk and financial liability back to the Owner.

- Guaranteed Maximum
Guaranteed Maximum contracts are similar to Cost Plus Fee contracts in that the actual project costs are tracked and then a Contractor's fee is added. The difference is that there is a price ceiling or maximum that the contract can total. If the cost of the project exceeds the ceiling, the costs are the responsibility of the Contractor. This puts a lot of risk on the Contractor since these contracts are sometimes based on more preliminary plans and may not have all the details needed to accurately bid all scopes of work in detail. Sometimes these contracts include an incentive to get the project done for less than the maximum.

- Unit Price
Unit Price contracts are really only common on civil projects with a lot of sitework required. In this case, cost is based on quantities delivered rather than overall project cost, and payments are based on the quantities of work completed. Owners can negotiate based on unit prices, but this also results in extreme specificity and extreme cost monitoring.


No matter the contract type, the legal agreement reached between the General Contractor and the Owner is known as the Prime Contract.


**Building the Project Budget:**



## Procurement


Once subcontracts and purchase orders have been bought out, the Specialty Contractors and Vendors have the contractual assurances they need to start procuring materials and equipment for their scopes of work, as well as scheduling and lining up crews to complete the work. Similarly, the General Contractor has the contractual leverage they need to make sure that milestones and deadlines are met.

In this section, we will discuss how the project schedule drives the order in which materials are procured and crews are scheduled, and then take a closer look at how Contractors gain approvals on their materials and equipment before they proceed with ordering and fabricating items.

**Building the Project Schedule :**

So, how do we even begin to predict how long a construction project will take to build? All projects start with something called Master Planning. This work is used to determine the major milestones and completion dates that will inform the overall duration of the project. Typically, throughout the Preconstruction phase and Construction phase stakeholders are involved in creating and updating the master planning schedule.

There are many techniques, methods, and theories when it comes to building an effective project schedule. We won't dive into all of that here, but having an understanding of how a project is scheduled will help you better grasp how things function in the next phase of the project. 

Scheduling can help construction teams determine who should be onsite and when, and in what sequence things should be completed. Similarly, the schedule helps inform the General Contractor, Specialty Contractor and Design Team of when certain materials must be ordered to arrive on time for the project.

**Submittals:**

Before General and Specialty Contractors order their materials and equipment or begin fabricating items in their shops, they seek approvals to ensure that they are ordering/fabricating the correct items.

A submittal is the written or physical information provided by a Contractor to the Design Team for final approval--a formal confirmation--of building materials and equipment before they are ordered, fabricated, and delivered to the project. The General Contractor and Specialty Contractor will use the schedule we discussed in the previous section to help them prioritize their submittals.

**Why is There a Procurement Process?**

We start the Procurement process during Preconstruction to make sure that materials and Specialty Contractors are prepared to arrive onsite at the right time during Construction. It can take weeks or months to receive orders and to fabricate materials or to have crew availability. Having a Procurement process gives Contractors the strong start they need to be successful on their projects. Note that the Procurement process often continues into the Construction phase.
