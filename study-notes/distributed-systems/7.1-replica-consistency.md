# Replica Consistency

- We have seen how to perform replication:
    - using read/write quorums
    - state machine replication using total order broadcast.
- Now lets talk about consistency in replication.

### Consistency

- Unfortunately the word “consistency” means different things in different contexts
- What it is ?
- Is it **ACID transaction** consistency in DB.
    - that is, we can say that a database is in a consistent or inconsistent state, meaning that the state satisfies or
      violates certain invariants defined by the application
- Is it **Read-after-write consistency** (We have seen earlier)
- It is Replication :
    - we have used “consistency” informally to refer to a relationship between replicas:
    - we want one replica to be consistent with another replica.
- Since there is no one true definition of consistency, we speak instead about a variety of **consistency models**

### Consistency Models

- We have seen one particular example of a consistency model, namely **read-after-write consistency**
    - which restricts the values that a read operation may return when the same node previously writes to the same data
      item
- There few more like, Strong consistency, sequential consistency, eventual consistency, Causal consistency etc.
