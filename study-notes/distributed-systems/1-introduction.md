# What is distributed Systems

Distributed systems consists of lot of nodes that communicate  and co-ordinate with each other to perform some tasks.
To design the distributed systems there are some fundamental challenges that need to to be solved and tackled.

- Communication
- Co-ordination
- Scalability
- Resiliency
- Operations

The basic problem is 
- communication can fail and 
- node can crash.
- Or both

We want the system as a whole to be fault tolarent that means it continue to work even though some part of the system is faulty.

# Communication

- TCP
- http
- rpc
