## Component Details

## Goals and Inputs

### Goals
Goals in Agentic AI represent the desired outcomes that the system is expected to achieve. They share similarities with prompts in GenAI but typically require multi-step processes across multiple tools.

Key characteristics of goals:
- Expressed in natural language or may include other media types
- Require multiple steps or tasks to achieve completion
- Each instance may need different sequences of steps
- Can originate from end users or client applications
- May result in generated output or system actions

Example goals:
- Mathematical problem solving requiring step-by-step breakdown
- Root cause analysis of errors in log files using log repositories and knowledge bases
- Code analysis tasks like memory leak detection in GitHub projects
- Document creation and distribution workflows
- Complex computations like route optimization between locations

### External Inputs
- Additional knowledge and observed data that support goal achievement
- Contextual information needed for goal processing
- System state and environmental data

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator serves as the central manager of the Agentic AI system, coordinating communications between all components to achieve set goals. It acts as the system's command center with the following key responsibilities:

### Key Functions
- Acts as the single point of contact for external clients, handling input/output
- Maintains knowledge of available services, tools, and their capabilities
- Coordinates with the planner to create task workflows for given goals
- Manages executor interactions for task implementation
- Alternates between planning and execution phases as needed
- Monitors execution progress and implements error handling
- Maintains system state through memory management
  - Tracks chat history
  - Records tool execution results
  - Maintains audit trails
- Manages multiple planning-execution iterations until goals are met

### Workflow Management
- Initiates planning cycles by consulting the planner
- Delegates task execution to the executor
- Evaluates execution results and determines next steps
- Coordinates error recovery and alternative approaches when needed
- Ensures goal completion through iterative refinement

## Planner

### Core Responsibilities
- Creates execution plans for achieving goals
- Maintains inventory of available tools and their capabilities
- Breaks down complex goals into smaller, manageable subgoals
- Identifies and sequences required tasks based on dependencies
- Determines if tasks can be executed sequentially or concurrently
- Selects appropriate tools for task execution
- Creates workflows considering task dependencies and tool capabilities
- Manages input/output relationships between tasks

### LLM Integration
- Collaborates with LLM for plan creation and execution
- Uses LLM for:
  - Understanding user inputs and context
  - Task decomposition and subtask creation
  - Tool selection from available inventory
  - Determining next steps based on previous results
  - Generating final outputs

### Memory Management
- References memory for past similar requests
- Updates memory with planning decisions and outcomes
- Uses execution history for context-aware planning

### Example Workflow
For a goal like "What is the return policy for items in order 1001?", the planner might:
1. Use Tool 1 to retrieve order items
2. For each item, use another tool to fetch return policies
3. Aggregate results and format response
4. Store execution path in memory for future reference

## Executor

The Executor is responsible for implementing the tasks and actions designed by the planner. It serves as the system's implementation arm with the following capabilities:

### Primary Responsibilities
- Executes tasks according to the planner's specifications
- Interfaces with various tool types:
  - Function calls
  - REST API endpoints
  - Queue interfaces
  - Other integration points
- Provides input parameters to tools as specified
- Collects and processes tool execution results
- Returns execution outcomes to the orchestrator
- Performs result validation and basic error handling

### Additional Capabilities
- Conducts goal routing when needed
- Performs reflection on execution results
- Manages tool execution state
- Handles parallel task execution when possible
- Implements retry logic for failed operations

### Implementation Notes
- Can be combined with orchestrator in some implementations
- May be referenced by alternative names (runner, worker, manager)
- Maintains consistent interface regardless of implementation approach
- Focuses on efficient task execution and result handling

## Tools
