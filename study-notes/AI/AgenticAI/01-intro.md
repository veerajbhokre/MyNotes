# Introduction to Agentic AI

## Basic GenAI Uses and Limitations
Discusses the fundamental uses and limitations of Generative AI.

## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act independently to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to inputs, agentic AI can:

- Plan and execute tasks autonomously
- Make decisions based on context and goals
- Learn from interactions and outcomes
- Adapt strategies as circumstances change

### Key Characteristics
- **Autonomy**: Can operate independently without constant human intervention
- **Goal-oriented**: Works towards specific objectives rather than just responding to prompts
- **Adaptive**: Learns from experience and adjusts its approach
- **Context-aware**: Understands and considers its environment and constraints

## An Agentic AI Example
Imagine a digital assistant that helps manage your calendar:

**Traditional AI** would simply add events when asked.

**Agentic AI** would:
- Proactively suggest optimal meeting times
- Reschedule conflicts automatically
- Learn your preferences over time
- Consider factors like travel time and preparation needs
- Coordinate with other participants' calendars

## Benefits and Challenges of Agentic AI

### Benefits
- **Increased Efficiency**: Automates complex decision-making processes
- **Continuous Operation**: Works 24/7 without fatigue
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves performance over time through experience
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Consistency**: Maintains reliable performance levels

### Challenges
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring AI makes morally sound decisions
- **Control and Oversight**: Maintaining appropriate human supervision
- **Technical Complexity**: Requires sophisticated implementation
- **Resource Requirements**: May need significant computational power
- **Trust Building**: Gaining user confidence in autonomous systems

## Technologies for Agentic AI

### Core Technologies
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Foundation for natural language understanding and generation
- **Neural Networks**: Enable learning and pattern recognition
- **Planning Algorithms**: Support goal-oriented decision making
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Store and connect information meaningfully

### Development Frameworks
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Agent Frameworks**: OpenAI Gym, RLlib
- **Natural Language Processing**: Transformers, BERT
- **Integration Tools**: APIs, SDKs for connecting components

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Computing Resources**: GPUs, TPUs for model training
- **Storage Systems**: Distributed databases for knowledge management
- **Network Architecture**: Real-time communication capabilities
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance and behavior tracking
